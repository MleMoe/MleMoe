### Hi there 👋, I'm MleMoe (may call me Mia ~ ).

I'm a graduate student majoring in Computer Science at Communication University of China. Like coding and digital art.

- 🔭 I just interned at @Alibaba as a front-end development engineer. Now concentrate on writing graduation design and thesis.
- 🤔 I want to make a cross-end mobile AR framework with a little intelligence and fun.
